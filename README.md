# Project Title: Bad Bank Application

## Description/Motivation:
The Bad Bank Application is designed to simulate a banking system with a twist. Instead of providing a secure and reliable platform for financial transactions, this application serves as an example of what not to do when building a bank application. It is created purely for educational and demonstration purposes, aiming to highlight common mistakes and vulnerabilities that can be found in poorly designed banking systems.

The motivation behind this project is to help developers and users understand the potential risks and pitfalls associated with insecure banking applications. By examining and exploring the flaws in this "bad bank," individuals can gain a better understanding of the importance of proper security practices and learn how to build robust and safe applications.
